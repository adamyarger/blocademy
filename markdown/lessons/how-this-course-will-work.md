## Welcome to Blocademy

Blocademy is an open source compilation of resources dedicated to providing the best information to help you learn blockchain. Blockchain is still in its early stages and theres not many solid resources for learning everything you need to get a job in the industry, blocademy is trying to fix this. This is currently a work in progress, so please bear with me as I get this thing off the ground.



## Introduction

In this unit, we'll learn about what lead to the creation of blockchain and crypto currencies, that means a history lesson.

In order to understand how cryptocurrencies work, we have to start from first principles, and take a field trip back in time to the multitude of technologies that converged to crate the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.

Each of the following section and lessons represents essential baseline knowledge. Even if you have no intention of becoming a blockchain developer, this material should help you gain a useful understanding of how blockchain and crypto currencies work.

Learning blockchain is like building a skyscraper of knowledge, if you have a shaky foundation you're bound to tumble as you get higher up. Thats why this first course is called foundation.

- What will we cover in course?



## How It Works

This curriculum works by pulling together the best content from across the internet for learning a particular topic. In each lesson, we'll introduce the topic and try to provide you will some context and motivation before sending you off to external resources to go more in depth.

We believe people learn best by doing, we try to include exercises or projects for each major topic. Do not skip these, this is where you're going to struggle and learn the most. In addition, there will be a round up of questions you should be able to answer before you move on. As Richard Feynman said, "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself -- and you are the easiest person to fool".



## What Comes Next

Once you've completed the foundation course, you should be pretty comfortable with the building blocks of blockchain and cryptocurrency. This is just the beginning, it's now time to start playing with real world blockchains, ethereum in particular.

- Ethereum has by far the most resources and developers
- This curriculum is a work in progress, but know everything included is there for a reason. Remember we're building a skyscraper of knowledge and thats done one level at a time.
- Final note: if you have zero expereince with computer science or web development youll most likely find a lot of this quite difficult. Blockchain is made possible by the internet and software, so we recommend you get a good base knowledge of web development before continuing on. There a tons of resources for learning web development but we feel [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/home) is the best place to learn from, in fact its the website that motivated us to build blocademy.
