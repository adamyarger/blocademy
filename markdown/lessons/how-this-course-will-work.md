# Intro to Algorithms



### What are algorithms?

You've probably heard the term algorithm thrown around a lot. But what are they? An algorithm is a series of actions conducted in a certain order.

**Why should I care about algorithms and data structures?**

- Blockchain is a data structure and what that happens on the but blockchain is a series of algorithms that interact with the blockchain data structure.
- There are 5 major data structures were going to cover that relate to blockchain. We're going to start by going over hat each one does and why its used in blockchain. At the end of the article we're going to build our own implementation of each data structure along with the algorithms that interact with it. Do your best to understand how each data structure works.
- If you've never worked with data structures or algorithms do not skip this, I know this is going to be difficult but it's fundamental to understanding how blockchain works. Remember we're building a skyscraper of knowledge, we want to make sure we have a solid foundation before building higher.
- Go over real world uses of the data structures mentioned, skip how they're used in blockchain for now.
- We're going to circle back to how each of these data structures is used in blockchain.



**Assignment**

- We're going to use python to build each of our data structures, mainly because its easy for almost anyone to pick up.
